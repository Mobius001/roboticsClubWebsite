# roboticsClubWebsite
An amalgamation of the parallax tutorial from Traversy Media and the modern portfolio tutorial to create a unique and responsive website for a school robotics club.

As things have gotten a little more complex, I realize that I should have invested more time into designing for smaller devices first before getting into the nitty gritty. 

But first, the scout face from Team Fortress 2 is there as a placeholder until the robotics club comes up with a logo. 
I put the face there to make some of my friends, and myself have a small chuckle. Hopefully you find it amusing too! If you don't know what I am talking about, it is found when you open the navbar at the top right of your screen.

Some current major issues are that the picture where the scoutface is won't shrink on mobile. And that the parallax effect is not working on Android or iOS devices. On Android, the pictures are sized okay. On iOS, the pictures are not automatically resized to fit the screen at all and are blown up. I think that by reducing the size of the images and placing them into a separate folder for organization's sake would be the next step to take in order to resolve this.
